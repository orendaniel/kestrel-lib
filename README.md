##Kestrel vision library


Kestrel is a simple and lightweight computer vision library for the Lua language written in C.

##Why should I not choose Kestrel over X


Kestrel is designed to be simple and lightweight, as such many features
that are included in other computer vision libraries are ignored.


Furthermore Kestrel is still under development and is currently unstable.
